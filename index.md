## About Me
![ryan-l](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryanliulwy/CSE110-Lab1/main/images/ryan_liu.png)

Hello! I'm Ryan, a second year Computer Science major here at UC San Diego in Revelle College. A few things I enjoy spending my free time doing:
1. **Hanging out with friends**
   - Here's a [goofy picture](images/hatstack.png) they took of me and a mighty stack of hats a while back
2. **Playing video games**
   - Recently I've been getting into a game called _The Finals_
   - I've also been playing a lot of modded _Terraria_ these days
   - Unfortunately, my friends also drag me into their _League of Legends_ matches
3. **Practicing the piano**
   - I used to take part in piano competitions before ([here's a recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncm4KW2-Qyw) of one of the hardest pieces I learned!)
   - Now I mostly do it for fun and play music from shows and games I like :)

Here's a funny code block I picked up off the floor. I wonder what it does...?
```
